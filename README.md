PROJECT: Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption.
LANGUAGE: Python
INTERNSHIP: Codecraft Infotech – Cybersecurity_02

DESCRIPTION:
This project is a GUI-based Image Encryption Tool built using Python,
Tkinter, and Pillow. It demonstrates basic image encryption using pixel
manipulation techniques. Users can select an image, enter a numeric key,
and encrypt or decrypt the image using simple, reversible operations.Since XOR and row-swaps are reversible, running the same transformation
twice with the same key returns the original image.
